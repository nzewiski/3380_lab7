		<h2>Information:</h2>
			<p>This web application allows you to execute a search based on city, country, or language name. Input your name into the text box and select the bubble that
				corresponds to the type of name you're searching for. The program searches letter by letter so searching for "A" will display all results that start with the 
				letter A, searching "AB" will display all results starting with "AB" and so on. The search function is also not case sensitive. Once you get your results, you
				may edit the database by clicking either the update or delete button in the row you wish to edit. Clicking Delete will obviously delete the entry and clicking 
				Update will allow you to change specific fields based on the data type in that given row. You may also click the "Insert into city" button to create a city
				of your own to add to the database.
